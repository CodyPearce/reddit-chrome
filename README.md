![](/images/small-tile.png)

### Description
Browse reddit on any page in a popup extension. Secretly browse reddit at work or school while pretending to check emails or look up vital information. No matter where you are on the internet you can browse reddit.

Click the icon and an extension will pop out loading the first 25 posts of the last subreddit you were browsing sorted by "hot". Links, images, and User accounts will open a new tab when clicked. Comments and selfposts will open directly in the extension. Comments are sorted by the default setting of the post and are limited by reddit's api. Opening a new comment section will close the previous one. 

You can change to any subreddit by clicking the change sub button and entering the subreddit you would like to browse. You can load the next page by clicking the load more button at the bottom.
